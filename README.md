# EcoPulp

Welcome to EcoPulp, an innovative initiative dedicated to the responsible collection, recycling, and conservation of unused exam paper sheets. Our mission is to provide an easy, bulk-friendly solution to minimize paper wastage, save trees, water, and provide employment opportunities to marginalized communities.


## What We Do

At EcoPulp, we believe in simplicity and sustainability. Here's what we do:

### 1. Paper Collection

We collect waste paper from educational institutions and individuals, ensuring that no unused paper goes to waste. By doing so, we help reduce the environmental impact of paper wastage.

### 2. Separation and Recycling

Our dedicated team separates the fresh and used pages from the collected paper. The used pages are moved for further processing, while the unused ones are put to good use.

### 3. Creating New Notebooks

We use the unused pages to create new, high-quality notebooks. This not only reduces paper wastage but also provides valuable work opportunities to marginalized communities, thereby empowering them.

## The EcoPulp Impact

Here's how your participation in EcoPulp makes a significant difference:

### Financial Benefits

- We collect waste paper at competitive rates, contributing to your institution's finances.
- A portion of the proceeds goes toward clearing any outstanding dues with the college.

### Water Savings

- The paper-making process consumes a significant amount of water. By recycling paper, we save thousands of liters of water.

### Notebooks and Employment

- We create a substantial number of notebooks from the collected paper, which can be used or sold.
- By engaging marginalized communities in the notebook-making process, we provide meaningful employment opportunities.

### Empowering Workers

- We believe in fair wages. By working with EcoPulp, you're contributing to the livelihoods of those involved in the collection and recycling process.
